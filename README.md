Browsers behaviours
========================
2016-10-03


From time to time I encouter some implementations differences between browsers.

When this happens, I try to post the results of my experiments here.


Here is what I've got so far:

- [button keypress click, and prevent](https://github.com/lingtalfi/browsers-behaviours/blob/master/button-keypress-click/button-keypress-click.md)
- [offsetWidth, boundingClientRect, clientWidth, scrollWidth](https://github.com/lingtalfi/dimensions-cheatsheet)
- [getBoundingClientRect with a button containing an icon](https://github.com/lingtalfi/browsers-behaviours/blob/master/get-bounding-client-rect/bcr-icon.md)
